## 🧠 Game Overview

### 🧩 Phase 1 – Key Placement
- Each player takes turns placing **12 keys**.
- **You must not form a line of 3 or more** (horizontally or vertically).
- If you accidentally make a forbidden line, use **Undo** to revise your placement.

### ⚔️ Phase 2 – Move and Strike
- Once all keys are placed, players **move one key per turn**.
- **Form exactly a line of 3** to **strike** and remove one opponent's key.
- Victory is declared when your opponent is reduced to **2 or fewer keys** or has no strategic moves remaining.
